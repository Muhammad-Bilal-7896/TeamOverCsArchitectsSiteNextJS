He always had a passion for interior design and the rise of architectural firms in a region where the concept was not widely popular before, intrigued him. After conducting some research, he concluded that though the Pakistani community had become receptive to the idea of hiring professional help and most architectural firms represented a signature style. Ideas were thrown upon clients to choose from and the mere facade of a structure could reveal the designer behind it. Mr. Amer wanted his work to represent the dreams and desires of each unique customer rather than a symbolic product embodying the organization’s style. That is when the ‘customer centric’ Amer Adnan Associates was brought to life in 2002 with a majority of its residential and commercial projects taking place in the Punjab region. The AAA team now provides architectural design and construction services nationwide - specifically in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore.</h5>
